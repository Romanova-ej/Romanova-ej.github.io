Trip to Georgia took place in 2016 when I was a young to-be-bachelor (2nd year of SpSU). It was my first trip abroad without parents and with a boyfriend to-be-husband. 

Looking back, I recall a lot of warmth out of this time. There was a lot of youth, love and khachapuri  :) 

All the bookings were made by my father (quite logical considering that both Alex and I had no money of our own). Now it seems crazy: me not taking a leading part in planning. Now I wouldn't bear it as I became trip planning freak in my father's footsteps.
For Alex it was the first abroud trip at all except for mooving to Russia from Kazakhstan. I remember that it wasn't easy to explain to him why it was absolutely necessary to travel. Georgia seemed to me an ideal country for a debut as it is not "too western" and many people there speak russian.

Mainly we were located in the small resort town Kobuleti, Adjara. It was a popular vacation spot for locals. Maybe now it is different, but I do not remember ever running into russians there (which is always a good thing, bless me). The region had been flooded recently so a lot of tourists from the country had not arrived and the town was not crowded.

The sea was right under our nose, but it's hard to call the beach perfect. There were huge pieces of rocks here and there which could cause you a lot of pain with stormy waves as accomplices. It was quite funny though to swim in it, but of course not completely safe.

One of the main problems of life named "Where are we going to eat" arose immediately. Alex voted for a caffe that looked shabby but was packed with natives. I has a prejdice against it but agreed. So we visited the place which still was not beated even if I tried a lot of georgian food since. It has a big con though. The jukebox. I still shudder when remembering those sounds.
As we very soon had known, the favorite song of all times for natives was "Vladimirsky central" (Владимирский централ). And they didn't skimp on the volume at all.
So the place was named after the song but we still wasn't resistant enough to its food so we had put up with their tastes for music. 
It wasn't unusual for them to listen something like that, actually. Later, when traveling by minibuses, we discover that it is indeed quite common to listen for russian shanson in public places.
Nevertherless, food was marvelous! As well as the prices. On our first visit we take three hachapury, as they were so cheap that they just could not be big. Well... of course they were huge and we was not able to swallow all of it. 
The place, as I have mentioned, was always crowded. It leaded to such events like natives joining our table and having a chat with Alex (women, it seemed, did not really counted). It was a bit awkward, but truly atmospheric. 
The cheapest and the tastyest place.

At one of the days we took minibus to the waterfall called ''. Because of the recent flood it had become immense. I believe that in that condition it looks much more impressive so we were kind of lucky. On the other hand, the river crossing nearby lost its beauty due to the stream. 

On that little trip we also visited Queen Tamara's Bridge. As you see, it is quite tiny in the means of width. And without any handrail. 
On that bridge happend one of the most fearfull moments of my life. When I was standing on a bridge, somebody frightened the cow on the other end and it run. Run right into me on that damned thin bridge. I manadged to step aside and not fall into the wild waters but the moment the cow was passing me by I am not to forget.

After that occurence I kept a grudge on all cows. Look at its evil eyes!

The path home witch we took partialy busless was rather picturesque.

Trip to Georgia took place in 2016 when I was a young to-be-bachelor (2nd year of SpSU). It was my first trip abroad without parents and with a boyfriend to-be-husband. 

Looking back, I recall a lot of warmth out of this time. There was a lot of youth, love and khachapuri  :) 

All the bookings were made by my father (quite logical considering that both Alex and I had no money of our own). Now it seems crazy: me not taking a leading part in planning. Now I wouldn't bear it as I became trip planning freak in my father's footsteps.
For Alex it was the first abroud trip at all except for mooving to Russia from Kazakhstan. I remember that it wasn't easy to explain to him why it was absolutely necessary to travel. Georgia seemed to me an ideal country for a debut as it is not "too western" and many people there speak russian.

Mainly we were located in the small resort town Kobuleti, Adjara. It was a popular vacation spot for locals. Maybe now it is different, but I do not remember ever running into russians there (which is always a good thing, bless me). The region had been flooded recently so a lot of tourists from the country had not arrived and the town was not crowded.

The sea was right under our nose, but it's hard to call the beach perfect. There were huge pieces of rocks here and there which could cause you a lot of pain with stormy waves as accomplices. It was quite funny though to swim in it, but of course not completely safe.

One of the main problems in life called "Where are we going to eat?" arose immediately. Alex voted for a cafe that looked shabby but was packed with locals. I had a prejudice against it but finnaly agreed. This is how we discovered a place the food of which is still unbeaten, even though I have tried a lot of Georgian food since then. Although there was a big flaw. The jukebox. I still shudder remembering those sounds.
As we very soon had learnt, the favorite song of all times among locals was "Vladimirsky central" (Владимирский централ). Visitors kept asking the automat to play it on and on and they did not like when the volume was at any measure low.
We had named the place after the song but we still wasn't resistant enough to its food so we put up with their tastes for music. 
It wasn't unusual for georgians to listen to something like that, actually. Later, when traveling by minibuses, we discover that it is indeed quite common to listen for russian shanson in public places.
Nevertherless, food was marvelous! As well as the prices. On our first visit we take three hachapury, as they were so cheap that they just could not be big. Well... of course they were huge and we was not able to won that battle.
The place, as I have mentioned, was always crowded. It leaded to such events like old men joining our table and having a chat with Alex (women, it seemed, did not really counted). It was a bit awkward, but truly atmospheric. Yeah, the longest paragraph of this article is about a cafe :D.

One day we took a minibus to the waterfall called 'Makhuntseti'. Because of the recent flood it had become immense. I believe that in that condition it looks much more impressive so we were kind of lucky. On the other hand, the river crossing nearby may have lost some of its beauty due to the stream.

On that little trip we also visited Queen Tamara's Bridge. As you see, it is quite tiny in the means of width. And without any handrail.

On that bridge happend one of the most fearfull moments of my life. When I was standing on a bridge, somebody frightened the cow on the other end and it run. Run right into me on that damned thin bridge. I manadged to step aside and not fall into the wild waters but the moment the cow was passing me by I am not to forget.

After that occurence I've kept a grudge on all cows. Look at its evil eyes!

The path home witch we took partialy busless was rather picturesque. Water is everywhere.

The same could be said about cows, unfortunately...

Here you can imagine a picturesque crossing of rivers.

Train it! Imagine!

We took a peek at local wine cellar, but it was a tipical tourist place, although the nature is impressive nevertheless.

On the other day we went to botanic garder of Batumi that is also located near to the sea. Again we used minibuses with its usual chanson accompaniment. 
Out of the window:

Botanic garder was a really nice place but now I dare say I have seen much more impressive garderns. Then, though, we enjoied it a lot. The day was awfully hot so it was a pleasure to hide ourselves in the shade under the ancient trees.

Snake felt itself very organic in the Japanese garden. It did not convince me though. The rest of the wanderings were tinged with fear.

Sometimes trees seem to be impossible. Thought about it a lot in Vietnam (see more recent post about Vietnam).

Batumi town itself did not impress me at all though. It was all made up and unnatural, like a big barby's house. And I dare say I indicated a lack of taste in architecturers who took part in its building. Walking there still was nice but no more than that. I cannot really understand what people see in towns like that one.

One thing I appreciated in Batumi was that monument. It was moving:  male and female were approaching each other, passing through and moving away. For us it was a very actual plot since in autumn we were to part again to study in different cities.

The unsets there were perfect

Afterwards we moved to Tbilisi, but I'll tell about it another time.

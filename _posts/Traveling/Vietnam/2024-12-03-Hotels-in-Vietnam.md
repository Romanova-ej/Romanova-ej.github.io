So here I am again,  writing an aggregation post instead of a proper one about Vietnam travel route or cities or whatever. 
But since I put on a semblance of writing this blog solely for myself... I'll keep doing it. At least I will use English to pet my guilty conscience. 
So, now I want to describe the process of hotel choosing. 

When planning the trip I needed to find places to stay at four cities / towns:

**1.** Da Nang (3 nights)

**2.** Hoian (An bang to be precise, 5 nights) 

**3.** Ninh-Binh (4 nights)

**4.** Hanoi (5 nights)

**5.** Halong (1 night on the boat). 

Let's start from the beginning. 


# Da Nang

<!-- Here we were to stay for 3 nights. The main criterias were quite ordinary: it should be located not far from the sea, not far from the center and food, the room should be large, there should be no mentions about poor soundproofing in reviews.  -->

The funny thing about Da Nang hotels was their ignorance with people's need for privacy. The majority of hotel rooms had two windows. One from the room to the street and one huge window from the toilet to the room. So as not to be separated even for a minute, apparently. For us it was not really a problem but it was strange to say the least. Sometimes jalousie were provided but not necessarily.

A couple of random examples from booking.com:

Very nice indeed. And it did not really correlate with the costyness of the room as we were looking at different prices (in general, hotel prices in central Vietnam are quite low, even with our rouble problems).

The hotel I finally decided to stay at did not have this open-mind (and body!) feature though. I'm even disappointed a bit now. What a chance we've missed.

We took apartments at Lagom Boutique hotel. The design was fine and there was no complaining about the sound from fellow travelers. In fact, the sound there definitely was.

We arrived at 9 and swam a bit at the pool on the roof. It was a nice experience and a good way to relax after hard trip from Russia. I was a bit smitten about the strange sound there like something cracked. Later I discovered that frogs there do very similar sound... I doubt that it could be frog in the pool on the roof, but still, I am happy that I did not know how their frogs speak back then.

Location of the hotel proved itself quite well, but each early (really early!) morning and each late (really late!) evening we heard recorded screams "Ban Bao! Ban Bao!" from the trader on a bike. It was that loud as we were outside with him, eating this damn (divine!) buns.

# Hoian (An Banh)

I preferred to live near the sea rather than in the culture center of Hoian as it seems more natural to take a taxi to the old city than to the sea. 
Also Hoian is quite crowded place and I hoped for a calm vacation in a village. 

Here there was another peculiar thing about hotels.
I guess that vietnamese people much less anxious about physiological processes than western people. I should have comprehended it in Da Nang. Even in most pricey hotels they tended to forget about the door to the toilet. Sometimes it's not just about the door, but also about ordinary walls.
Often it was some kind of an area, partly hidden, but not truly separated. 

Well... it was a bit too much fo me. With all these unfamiliar foreign food to taste, it was highly probable that the moment would come when one of us would need some privacy and peace. 
Until the very end I had two bookings, but from unhappened one I received a letter saying that they had a big noisy construction site nearby and they advised me to move on in my search. Again I've lost my chance to try a toilet in the room. What a disappointment.

Our final hotel (homestay as the most of them) was one of the kind with a door (it's a miracle!). The shower though still was not to have any borders. But I did not see the room with it at all on booking.com. 

Our hotel was quite decent. It was located a little deeper into the neighborhood, away from the noisy main road. It was kept in the local style and led by the very warm family.

Here we had gecko for a pet. I was petrified by the husband's new best friend but he (the husband) assured me that "it'll behave". I still did awake in the middle of the night out of the dream about it touching me though. Alex was not convincing enough.

Inside the room you could not hear a sound from the other guests or the street but... damn those birds! They were singing the exactly same tune all the time, it was terribly loud and started at 4 in the morning. When I hear it in our videos, the tic starts.
Well... there was also a lot of geckos outside that sometimes chatted with our roommate. If you don't know "what does the gecko say" I advice you to google it. Unforgettable. 
Not the most welcome thing in the night. But afterall... it's fun to recall it now. Alex was charming when asked our hostess the status of the gecko (he really thought that it was a pet). Better not to show him this post. 

From there it was 5 minutes to the sea, 2 minutes to the main road and 7 minutes to the local market.
Nice place with a toilet door. Thanks for that, really.

# Ninh Binh

Ninh-Binh itself did not interested us much (like most tourists). The places of attraction are national parks around it. 
We planned to visit Hang Mua, Tam Coc, Trang An and just ride around the area on bicycle. 

Near the parks there were villages. The largest one was called Tam Coc. It is the most popular place in the area with a lot of restaurants and bars. At first I was occupied by the hotel near Hung Mua, but we decided against it because the village was really small and it had only 2-3 voted restaurants which was not necessarily of our taste. In addition, we really would like to taste more food as we are partially a gastro tourists. Besides, in Vietnam the darkness falls early and it was likely that we would need to ride our bikes in a complete darkness of the edge of the village which was not an intended behaviour of ours. 

The problem was that I really disliked Tam Coc by its own by all the photos I googled. But it was the best choice. After our trip I am sure that we made the right choice, especially considering that we had the best hotel ever there. I still did not really like the town (except maybe its deeper non-touristic streets), but the location is optimal, nature is outstanding and there was a lot of food. When we ate in a small villages during cycle trips, we experienced more local kitchens that led by one family, but usually they were not great and the time for getting food was extremely long. 

The Tam Coc Moment (The hotel we stayed) was led by the nicest couple with good english skills. They gave us a lot of valuable advices and provide us with the best service. And it's I am to say so. With all my know-it-all don't-want-your-advice emploi.

In Tan Coc they still sometimes were forgetting about the doors to the toilets, but not generally. Borders in the shower still were rare. We had a half-border, it's a win.

# Hanoi 

Hanoi, after Central Vietnam and Ninh-Binh, astonished me with hotel prices. They seemed even higher than in Moscow. And for that insane money you were getting less than 20 or even 15 meters of space. 
I saw a couple of decent-looking apartments at a good price but they were somehow suspicious so I decided against. I managed to book one room at a reasonable price in the center of the old quarter. 
The gem of it was the silence it provided despite the location. There was no windows to the street (just to the inside stairs), but maybe it was the only way to block all this crazy sound of Hanoi. It was located in the middle of the Old Quarter, so it was quite a noise outside, but choose this location, because it was most convenient for the early departure to Halong.

But of course even here we could not help but encounter some troubles. 
When arriving, we had to go through a narrow corridor and climb up a stairs. But on the staircase a huuuuge cockroach was sitting, baring his enormous teeth (well, I'm a bit exaggerating). 
Keeping the role of "those russians" (dull, evil but brave), we pulled ourselves together and... messaged the hostess, begging her to come down and save us. 

So she did but I think we did not imagine her smirking slightly (who wouldn't).

The place was quite okay, the best we could manage without feeling like it wasn't worth it.

# Halong

Halong...Halong... I nearly lost my sanity over this! To find the perfect boat room is just... **impossible** since there is no such thing. 
I've read everything (everything!) about it and still...

It started with too much location options: turned out that there are Halong - Halong, Lan Ha - Halong ad Bai Tu bay - Halong. 
Halong - Halong seemed to be a bit more picturesque and these cruises' itinerary included the view-point at the top of the Titov mountain with a heart-breaking view.
I was ill about this view. Photos taken from that point would be just perfect. (I refuse to show the picture from the Internet here, it's still a bit painful).
 But Halong - Halong often was used as a direction for the one-day trips, so crowds were promised to be enormous even to the means of not being able to climb to the top of the mountain due to the queue. 
Also, there was not a lot (actually, none) of good options for the night stay. 

The boats on Lan Ha bay were better, but still, none of them was ideal, not at all.
During my investigation it was discovered that food on board was bound to be nearly disgusting (for the overall price around 300$ per night) for all kind of the boats. 

Well... I am going to spare you the details of how I've spent endless evenings on that dilemma and finally ... **have not chosen anything**. Yes, I didn't choose the cruise in advance. There wasn't an ideal solution (even close), so I couldn't commit to one.
I postponed it until when we were in Central Vietnam but there... I did not manage to make a choice again. Again! It was the highest point of frustration and self-dissatisfaction. 
Finally, I decided that it would be better for me to give it to the chance for once. 

So, when we were saved from cockroach by our hostess in Hanoi, I kindly asked her to make booking for us. Something good. So she did. So we went. As simple as that.

In the end we've got a royal-level room at the price of the senior one on a decent boat with a pool and jacuzzi. 
The food was very poor, but we were prepared for that (and even took a pack of Pringles with us :D true royalty). All in all the experience was great, but it is not really a must-visit place (unlike Ninh Binh which is certainly is).
